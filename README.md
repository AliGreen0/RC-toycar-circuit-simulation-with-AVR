# RC-toycar-circuit-simulation-with-AVR
This repository contains simulation of an RC toycar. The simulation is done using proteus and we used AVR microcontrollers for programming reciver and transmitter. 

A keypad is used for controlling 2 DC motors.

TX is the transmitter file and RX is the reciever file.

The "p.DSN" file is the proteus simulation.

Have fun!!!
